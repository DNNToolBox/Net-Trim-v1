# Net-Trim (first version)
This page contains the first version of Net-Trim, which addresses the **regularized form** of the Net-Trim convex program discussed in the [NIPS (2017) paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6910-net-trim-convex-pruning-of-deep-neural-networks-with-performance-guarantee).

See *main.py* for an example of network training followed by a pruning. The *Additional Material* folder contains the NIPS paper, presentation and supplementary files. 

## New Version with Manual Available 
Starting June 20th, 2018, a new version of Net-Trim addressing the **original constrained form** of the convex program is available. The code, along with a comprehensive manual and the new version of the paper are available at the following links:
